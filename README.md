Libra coordinates training and rollout clusters, routes requests across
heterogeneous vLLM workers, and adapts resource allocation as workload pressure
changes during training.

This repository accompanies the paper **"Libra: Efficient Resource Management
for Agentic RL Post-Training"**. Read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.03077) for the full design.

## Latest News

- **2026-08-06** — Added multi-node Ascend NPU cluster support on the
  [`NPU_Support`](https://github.com/NetX-lab/Libra/tree/NPU_Support) branch,
  including Megatron-Core/HCCL training, vLLM Ascend rollout workers, Global
  Resource Planner integration, C-MLFQ scheduling, and Elastic Hybrid Pool
  execution. 
- **2026-08-03** — Libra was officially open sourced.


## System Overview

![Libra overview](docs/assets/libra-overview.png)

Libra splits RL post-training into a core training pool, a core rollout pool,
and an elastic hybrid pool. The Global Resource Planner chooses how many GPUs
belong to training and rollout, then selects the training parallelism and the
heterogeneous rollout TP buckets. The C-MLFQ scheduler routes rollout requests
through the core rollout pool according to causality-aware trajectory state.
Elastic execution applies planner decisions by moving capacity between the
training and rollout sides while keeping the core training process group stable.

## Features

- **Global Resource Planner (GRP).** Searches training and rollout allocations
  under a fixed GPU budget, including training TP/PP/DP choices and rollout TP
  bucket layouts.
- **Online dynamic replanning.** Periodically consumes runtime history and queue
  pressure, evaluates candidate allocations, and applies a new plan only when
  the expected benefit exceeds the configured transition cost.
- **C-MLFQ scheduler.** Maintains a causality-aware prefix tree from completed
  trajectories and routes new or resumed rollout requests to TP buckets based on
  observed tool-return state and remaining work.
- **Heterogeneous rollout cluster.** Runs multiple OpenAI-compatible vLLM
  instances with different tensor-parallel degrees, such as TP-1, TP-2, TP-4,
  and TP-8 buckets.
- **Elastic Hybrid Pool.** Moves complete external Megatron replicas between
  rollout and training without changing the fixed core topology. Joining uses
  asynchronous sharded snapshots, a real zero-gradient boundary, atomic state
  alignment, and frozen per-step membership. Active replicas receive the Core's
  post-AllReduce gradient and advance model and optimizer state in lockstep,
  without per-step checkpoint reloads.
- **Decoupled communication domains.** Gives each model-parallel lane an
  independent side-channel endpoint and injects external gradients before the
  immutable core DP All-Reduce, so membership changes never rebuild Megatron
  communicators.
- **Cluster-swap execution.** Supports no-spare-GPU resource exchange between
  rollout and training pools when the planner changes the allocation.
- **Async GRPO pipeline.** Decouples rollout and training, tracks policy
  versions, bounds off-policyness, and can recompute log probabilities before
  policy updates.
- **Agentic workloads.** Includes workflows and rewards for R2E-Gym,
  Search-R1, DAPO-Math-17K, GSM8K, and code-agent style experiments.

## Installation

Libra targets Linux NVIDIA GPU systems. Use Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 and an
NVIDIA driver compatible with the CUDA runtime shipped by PyTorch 2.7. A local
CUDA toolkit, C/C++ compiler, CMake, and Ninja are needed only when building
vLLM or grouped-GEMM extensions from source. Slurm is required only for the
provided cluster launchers.

Clone the repository and install it in an isolated environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NetX-lab/Libra.git
cd Libra

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -e .
```

The editable installation exposes the historical `RL_Framework` import name
independently of the checkout directory:

```bash
python -c "import RL_Framework; print(RL_Framework.__version__)"
```

The base installation uses a compatible vLLM wheel when one is available. If a
cluster requires a local build—for example because its glibc is older than the
wheel target—install the build toolchain and rebuild vLLM in the same
environment:

```bash
python -m pip install "ninja>=1.11" "cmake==3.26.4"
python -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps --no-binary=vllm \
  "vllm==0.9.2"
```

The default training backend is Megatron-Core. Install its pinned Bridge and
grouped-GEMM integration after activating the target environment:

```bash
bash scripts/install_megatron_core.sh
```

See [Environment setup](docs/env_creation.md) for offline wheelhouse creation,
source-build requirements, and compute-node validation. Use the same virtual
environment in every Slurm job.

## Testing

Run CPU-friendly tests first:

```bash
pytest -q \
  tests/test_cmlfq_scheduler.py \
  tests/test_preflight_planner.py \
  tests/test_global_resource_planner_simulators.py \
  tests/test_grpo_grouping.py \
  tests/test_runtime_elastic_executor.py
```

GPU, distributed, native-RDMA, and end-to-end tests are environment dependent.
See the production Slurm launchers under `scripts/` and the distributed or
elastic test suites under `tests/`.
